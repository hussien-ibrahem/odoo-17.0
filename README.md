# Odoo Learning Path
This repository contains custom Odoo modules that I worked on while learning Odoo development. The project includes two custom modules, Real Estate and To-Do App, built on Odoo 17. These modules are located in the odoo-17.0/odoo/custom_addons/ directory.

<h3>Modules</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Real Estate Module: </b>This module is designed to manage real estate properties, including creating, editing, and tracking property listings.</li>
  <li><b>To-Do App Module: </b>A simple task management app where users can create to-do lists, manage tasks, and set deadlines.</li>
</ul>


<h3>My Odoo Learning Journey</h3>
Throughout my Odoo learning process, I followed a series of tutorials covering a wide range of Odoo development concepts. Here are some of the key concepts Iâ€™ve learned:
<ul>
  <li><b>Security in Odoo: </b>Managing access rights, groups, and record rules.</li>
  <li><b>Views & User Interface: </b>Customizing form views, adding custom buttons, enhancing views with smart buttons, and using custom fonts in reports.</li>
  <li><b>APIs in Odoo: </b>Creating RESTful API endpoints, handling CRUD operations, and integrating with other apps.</li>
  <li><b>Database Operations: </b>Executing SQL queries, adding custom fields, and generating Excel reports.</li>
  <li><b>Odoo Architecture: </b>Understanding MVC architecture, using the env object, server actions, and cron jobs.</li>
  <li><b>Testing & Validation: </b>Adding unit tests, working with _sql_constraints, and enforcing field validations.</li>
  <li><b>Custom Wizards: </b>Implementing wizards for complex user interactions.</li>
</ul>





<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To run these modules, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Clone this repository into your Odoo custom addons directory.</li>
    <li>Add the path of these modules to your Odoo configuration file.</li>
    <li>Restart your Odoo instance and upgrade the modules from the Apps menu.</li>
</ol>





<h2>Useful Resources</h2>
<p>I gained knowledge from a variety of video tutorials and guides that helped me develop these modules. Some of the key concepts learned include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Adding translations.</li>
    <li>Enhancing form views.</li>
    <li>Creating and managing security groups and access rights.</li>
    <li>Handling Odoo API requests (CRUD operations).</li>

    <li>Generating reports (PDF, Excel).</li>
    <li>Adding custom buttons and smart buttons.</li>
</ul>
